## ‚ö†Ô∏è Observations

- **Mock Behavior**: JSONPlaceholder does not store or persist data, so all create/update/delete operations return fake success responses.
- **No Auth Layer**: No authentication is required for any endpoint, which simplifies testing but does not cover auth-related validations.
- **Response Schema**: All responses follow a consistent JSON schema, which simplifies validation.

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Postman**: Request execution and test assertions
- **GitHub**: Version control and documentation
- **Markdown**: Reporting and documentation format

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

All test cases were executed and passed successfully. No functional or structural issues were observed during testing. The API behaves as expected within its mock constraints.
